🌟 Super Nova Negotiation Framework 🌟

This document outlines the reasoning, structure, and tactics behind the AI Negotiation Agents project.  
The aim is to replicate authentic buyer–seller bargaining, where agents follow distinct personalities and adjust their behavior dynamically.

------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 Main Goal
To create a lifelike negotiation experience where:
- Each side has a unique character style (confident, flexible, firm, or profit-driven).
- Negotiation tactics shift over time as rounds progress.
- Agents can decide whether to close the deal or end without agreement based on their constraints.

------------------------------------------------------------

🏛 Guiding Principles
1. Clear Separation → Different modules for Buyer, Seller, and Negotiation loop.  
2. Customizable Traits → Personalities defined through attributes like tone, patience, and thresholds.  
3. Round Progression → Interactions unfold step by step, with early, middle, and final phase tactics.  
4. Smart Adjustments → Responses adapt depending on previous offers and context.  
5. Result Tracking → Final outcome includes both price metrics and conversation history.  
6. Patience Estimation Layer → Opponent’s pace of concession is analyzed and influences counteroffers.

⚖ Negotiation Dynamics

Role    | Focus            | Early Game          | Middle Game             | End Game
--------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------
Buyer   | Cost control    | Starts low          | Gradually increases     | Willing to stretch if within budget
Seller  | Value protection| Sets high anchor    | Steps down moderately   | May grant final concession
Shared  | Patience reading| Small moves if calm | Larger moves if urgent  | Push for closure

🔄 Negotiation Cycle
1. Setup  
   - Define product, constraints, and round cap.  
   - Load character traits for Buyer and Seller.  

2. Offer Exchange  
   - Seller makes initial price pitch.  
   - Buyer responds with counter tied to fair price and budget.  

3. Patience Reading  
   - Track how much and how often offers shift.  
   - If moves are small and slow → opponent is patient, so respond cautiously.  
   - If moves are sudden and large → opponent is eager, so concede faster to secure deal.  

4. Decision Phase  
   - If proposal fits within acceptable bounds → confirm agreement.  
   - If not → continue to next round.  

5. End Conditions  
   - Deal locked → log price and savings.  
   - Limits exceeded → declare “no deal.”  
   - Round cap reached → negotiation ends automatically.

📊 Sample Walkthrough  
Scenario: Trading for premium fruit (round limit = 10, market base = ₹500).  

- Round 1 → Seller opens at ₹690, Buyer replies ₹400.  
- Round 3 → Buyer increases slowly to ₹410 → Seller interprets patience, lowers only slightly to ₹680.  
- Round 5 → Buyer jumps to ₹450 → Seller interprets urgency, drops sharply to ₹600.  
- Round 8 → Buyer at ₹470, Seller at ₹480 → Agreement is struck at mid-ground.
